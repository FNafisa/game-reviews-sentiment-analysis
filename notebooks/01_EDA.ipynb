       "'They certainly dumbed down the series since the last release. Sure it raked in a larger audience but it sacrificed what is was previously in the process, which was once well written and unique instead became copy-paste and bland. The game completely omits that Triss did nothing but screw Geralt over with everything she\\'s done involving for the Sorceresses Lodge, most likely just to have her as a romance option. This isn\\'t the only thing it omits either.\\n\\nNothing says player hand holding like Geralt\\'s *detective vision* removing any player involvement in questing, and Geralt\\'s permanent monologuing to ensure the player knows what they\\'re seeing scene to scene on the rollercoaster. Most quests will follow the same formula of: Talk to person > get told to go somewhere > while at somewhere, learn the person you talked to first is morally dubious > but so is the new person you meet in the quest > get money from either person and move on to next quest.\\n\\nThe combat isn\\'t as good as the predecessor, there\\'s very little thought put into it, which isn\\'t really Witcher-like. Unsure how many variants of \"x time of day\" wraith there really are, but they\\'re overused in this. \\n\\nGwent was a good minigame, and the minigame shouldn\\'t be more enjoyable than the actual game. Unfortunately, Gwent was also poorly balanced. Fixed by the spin off expansion of Gwent that you can play instead with more balance, but more child friendly too, because swearing is bad.\\n\\nAll in all it\\'s a shame, they had some fantastic ideas in the game that were ruined by trying to dumb everything else down as much as possible. It\\'s also a great and interesting world. The gameplay is dull and generic. Quite the \"meh\" experience, for what could have been so much more.'"
